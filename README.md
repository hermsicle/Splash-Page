### Project Goal
I created this mini project taking the mobile first approach. First setting up the typography, then the layout, then deciding when the breakpoint should be for larger screens. In the form, I applied CSS transform effect with transitions to make the input fields pop up on focus &|| hover. Moreover, the user cannot click register without filling out the required input fields I set. Upon filling out the form properly, the user is prompted to a message.
